              post-quantum public-key signature systems. Leading experts have joined forces for the first time to explain
              the state of the art in quantum computing, hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, lattice-based
              cryptography, and multivariate cryptography. Mathematical foundations and implementation issues are included.

              not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or
              other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption
              key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the
              corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone
              can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be
              forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in
              “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems.
              A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and
              then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large
              secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where
              e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)).
              The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

              Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer.
              These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the

  abstract = { During the past decade, a series of related instructional concepts and approaches has been refined and 
              implemented which requires major adjustments in traditional patterns of instructional management and delivery. 
              These approaches are known by names such as 'mastery learning', 'individually programmed instruction', 
              'competency based education', and 'learner-responsive instruction', and they often produce impressive 
              improvements in the learning achievement of whole groups of 'average' and 'poor' students. 
              While understood and implemented in a variety of ways, they share a set of common underlying principles 
				and operational features identified here as 'outcome-based'. In describing these outcome-based philosophical 
				principles and program characteristics, this paper focuses on changes in the management of time, students, 
				instructional resources, and testing required of both teachers and administrators by such programs. 
				In brief, the paper develops the thesis and framework that outcome-based approaches require an instructional 
				management system that is assessment driven rather than assignment driven. Among other things, assessment 
				driven systems rely on the existence of time-flexible instructional delivery, student grouping, and 
				testing/assessment conditions in order to assure that virtually all students reach publicly acknowledged 
              and operationalized learning goals. This mode of management represents a major departure from the clock, 
              schedule, calendar, and age-grade based assignment structure within which conventional instructional systems operate.}

  abstract = {The looming threat of quantum attacks on the digital infrastructure protected by conventional
              cryptographic protocol has generated urgency in identifying and deploying countermeasures that can
              mitigate the threat. There is a need for stronger cryptographic schemes that combine the strengths of both
              classic and quantum technologies. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a potential solution that
              can withstand the challenges posed by advances in quantum computing. Owing to the increasing importance of
              PQC, the present research is an attempt to assess the existing research done so far so that the existing
              gaps can be identified which can then strengthen the existing literature. The systematic literature review
              presented in this work has outlined six key categories of PQC, namely, lattice-based, code-based,
              hash-based, multivariate, isogeny-based, symmetric-key-based cryptosystems. The study concluded that the
              advances made in quantum computing will result in the development of quantum computers with superior
              computational power. Such highly efficient quantum computers will have the ability to break the currently
              available cryptography schemes most used in a variety of practical applications. With the advent of
              quantum computing, the computational capabilities of the potential cyber attackers would grow exponentially,
              which would render the traditional cyber security measures inadequate. This calls for techniques like PQC
              to be developed and strengthen.},
